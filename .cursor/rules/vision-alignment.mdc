# Vision Alignment Rule

This rule ensures that all development work, prompts, and changes align with Teroka Digital's vision and positioning strategy as defined in `vision.md`.

## Core Principles

1. **Target Audience Focus**
   - All features and content must serve the "Overwhelmed Expert" avatar
   - Solutions should address the pain points of traditional business owners
   - Content must resonate with Malaysian business owners (35-55 age group)

2. **Value Proposition Alignment**
   - Every feature should support the primary UVP: "We turn traditional business owners into marketing winners with done-for-you content and creative that actually converts"
   - Solutions should emphasize the "Just Enough" philosophy
   - Features must align with the productized service model

3. **Package Structure Compliance**
   - Development should support the three-tier package system:
     - Try Out Package (RM4,450)
     - Growth Package (RM7,500) - HERO PACKAGE
     - Partner Package (Custom)
   - Features must be mappable to specific package offerings
   - No feature should contradict the package positioning

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Development Work
1. Before starting any new feature or component:
   - Review relevant sections of `vision.md`
   - Ensure alignment with target audience needs
   - Verify compatibility with package structure
   - Check against key differentiators

2. When writing code:
   - Use terminology consistent with vision document
   - Implement features that support the "Traditional Business Expertise" differentiator
   - Ensure UI/UX reflects the "Productized Simplicity" principle

### For Prompts and AI Interactions
1. Always include context from `vision.md`:
   - Reference target audience
   - Align with UVP
   - Consider package structure
   - Maintain positioning strategy

2. When requesting features or changes:
   - Specify which package the feature serves
   - Explain how it addresses target audience pain points
   - Demonstrate alignment with key differentiators

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding with any development or prompt, verify:

- [ ] Does this align with the target audience's needs?
- [ ] Does it support the primary UVP?
- [ ] Which package does this feature serve?
- [ ] Does it maintain the "Just Enough" philosophy?
- [ ] Is it consistent with the local market focus?
- [ ] Does it support the productized service model?

## Examples

### Good Example
```typescript
// Feature: Lead Capture Form
// Aligns with Growth Package (RM7,500)
// Serves "Overwhelmed Expert" by automating lead collection
// Supports UVP by converting visitors into leads

interface LeadFormProps {
  packageType: 'try-out' | 'growth' | 'partner';
  industry: 'dental' | 'legal' | 'f&b' | 'interior-design';
  // ... other props
}
```

### Bad Example
```typescript
// Feature: Complex Marketing Dashboard
// ❌ Too complex for target audience
// ❌ Doesn't align with "Just Enough" philosophy
// ❌ Requires technical expertise

interface MarketingDashboardProps {
  analytics: ComplexAnalytics;
  automationRules: AdvancedRules;
  // ... too complex for traditional business owners
}
```

## References

Always refer to these key sections in `vision.md`:
- Primary UVP Statement
- Target Audience Deep Dive
- Package Positioning
- Key Differentiators
- Messaging Framework

Remember: Every line of code and every feature should serve the goal of turning traditional business owners into marketing winners through done-for-you content and creative solutions.
